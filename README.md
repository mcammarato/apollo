Getting started:

1. Clone the repo or download, unzip, and navigate to the folder in terminal or command prompt.
2. Run 'npm install' or 'yarn --production' (if you're using yarn) to download server side dependencies.
3. Run 'bower install' to download client side dependencies.
4. Run 'gulp watch' to compile SCSS, LESS, and start BrowserSync.
5. Enjoy :)
